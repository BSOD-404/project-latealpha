        <p>Even at a young age, Vader exhibited exceptional piloting skills, and built the protocol droid C-3PO, specially modified to withstand Tatooine's sand and heat, for his mother. Once, while he was working in Watto's scrap yard, he found a broken
          servomotor he thought he could repair and use on the droid he was building and asked his master for it.</p>

        <p>By the age of 12, he had built his first lightsaber; after its construction, Kenobi said to him "Anakin, this weapon is your life." During one of their many adventures, he also rescued Kenobi after he fell into a nest of gundarks. During his time
          as Kenobi's apprentice, Skywalker was distrustful of teachers who corrected him, wondering if they were trying to put him in his place, knowing that many hadn't wanted him trained in the first place.</p>

          Windu, Kenobi and Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine watched—the latter of which was impressed. </p>

        <h4><span class="label label-default">Imperial high command</span></h4>
        <p>After the scout ships sent to Dantooine found the base abandoned, Tarkin ordered Vader to kill her immediately, but the Millennium Falcon was captured in the ruins of Alderaan by the Death Star's tractor beam. Identified as a suspicious ship from
          Mos Eisley, Vader concluded that they were trying to return the stolen plans to the Princess and went to inspect the freighter himself. Told that the crew had apparently abandoned ship after take-off, Vader gave orders for the ship to be scanned
          to be sure. At the same time, Vader sensed the presence of his old master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. When news reached him that the Princess had been released from her cell, Vader decided to confront Kenobi alone.Vader found Kenobi after he had deactivated
          a tractor beam terminal to allow the Falcon escape the battle station, and the two engaged in one final duel. During the fight, Vader noted that Kenobi's age had made him weak, but he told his former apprentice that he wouldn't win because he
          would become more powerful than Vader could ever imagine, even if he managed to kill him. As they fought, the two reached Bay 327 just as the Kenobi's companions and the Princess reunited to board the Falcon, only for Kenobi to see his latest
          apprentice, Luke Skywalker, Vader's son. As his former master gave him a mysteriously knowing smile, Vader struck him down when Kenobi raised his blade in surrender. Much to Vader's surprise, Kenobi's body disappeared, for his spirit had become
          one with the Force, and Vader tried to find remains in his robes but found none. As he did so, General Moradmin Bast asked who he was, and Vader answered "An old man who thought he could help gifted children. He was mistaken." Vader then tried
          to stop the Rebels from escaping but was prevented from doing so by the closing of the hangar doors by Skywalker's shot. After the Falcon’s escape, Vader met with Tarkin and confirmed that a homing beacon had been placed upon the ship and that
          they could follow the ship to the Rebel base.</p>
